# Comparing Clustering Approaches in Federated Learning for Electrical Load Prediction
Predicting energy demand accurately is paramount for efficient energy management. Traditional methods relying on centralized training raise concerns about data privacy. In contrast, federated learning conducts model training locally, exchanging only model updates, preserving data privacy effectively. Clustering plays a crucial role in federated learning, grouping similar devices to enhance model performance and privacy. This research addresses the challenge of accurately predicting energy demand by evaluating various clustering approaches—k-means, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), spectral, and hierarchical clustering—in conjunction with neural networks. The goal is to compare the effectiveness of different clustering methods, shedding light on the most suitable approaches and establishing best practices for future applications.

## Research Overview
The study utilizes an hourly energy usage dataset for buildings in British Columbia, provided by Makonin. Selected clustering methods, including k-means, DBSCAN, spectral, and hierarchical clustering, will be applied to this dataset. The resulting clusters' performance will be evaluated using neural networks to determine their effectiveness in predicting energy demand.
